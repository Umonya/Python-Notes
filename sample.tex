\section{A Section}
General text

Some mention of a \texttt{function()} within the text. A concept to be \textit{emphasised}. And this is a \textbf{seminal point}.

Now some code:
\begin{lstlisting}
>>> variable = 5    # Some comment
\end{lstlisting}

Where I refer to a \texttt{variable} by name.

\section{Python 3.0 remember!}

Some basic changes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{print "hey!"} becomes \texttt{print("hey!")}
    \item String formatting has changed!
    \item 1/2 = 0.5 (\texttt{int/int = double})
\end{itemize}

\section{To run}
Try \texttt{pdflatex umonya.tex}

You're going to need to install a bunch of tex packages - see the top of \texttt{umonya.tex} for the list

Add new chapters in \texttt{umonya.tex}
